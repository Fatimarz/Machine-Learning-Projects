# Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate various techniques and models applied to real-world problems. Each project is organized into its own directory, highlighting different aspects of machine learning from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Fatimarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/car_price_prediction)
**Overview:** This project focuses on predicting car prices based on features such as the year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, and more. The model employs various machine learning algorithms to provide accurate price estimates and is deployed locally using Flask.

**Key Features:**

Data: Utilizes a dataset with car attributes for training and testing.

Models: Includes regression algorithms to predict car prices.

Deployment: Deployed as a local web application using Flask.

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, Flask, Pandas, NumPy

## [Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/Fatimarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Student_performance_prediction)
**Overview:** This project aims to predict student performance based on study features. 

**Key Features:**

Data: Analyzed academic performance data to identify trends and factors influencing grades.

Models: Implemented Regression algorithms to predict student outcomes.

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy,Flask
