# Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate various techniques and models applied to real-world problems. Each project is organized into its own directory, highlighting different aspects of machine learning from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Fatimarz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/car_price_prediction)
**Overview:** This project focuses on predicting car prices based on features such as the year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, and more. The model employs various machine learning algorithms to provide accurate price estimates and is deployed locally using Flask.

**Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Flask, Pandas, NumPy
